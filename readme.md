# FrontEndWebDev-ClassProject - Louie's Pizza

Louie has the best pizza in town, but his small pizza shop is only known to some die-hard local fans.  Louie wants to expand his business and attract new customers so that more people can enjoy his amazing pizza.  Louie has contracted you to build a website for "Louie's Pizza" and he has provided you with a PDF with what he wants the final product to look like.  You will build a site that matches Louie's design in phases, with the final product being a marketing site that will help Louie grow his business.

## Challenge 1 - Starting From Scratch

In this challenge, we will scaffold our web project by creating a bare-bones html, css, and js file.  Then we'll add some content and add some simple styling.  We're building this site mobile-first, so our styling should target mobile devices first, and then later we will adjust our styles for larger screens via *media queries*.  

### Part A - Scaffolding a Site

1. Create an index.html file and copy this html into your newly created file:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Louie's Pizza</title>

    <!-- Insert Style Sheet Here-->

    <!-- Insert Google Fonts Here -->

</head>

<body>

    <!-- Header -->

    <!-- /Header -->

    <!-- Welcome -->

    <!-- /Welcome -->

    <!-- Mail List -->

    <!-- /Mail List -->

    <!-- History -->

    <!-- /History -->

    <!-- Food Menu -->

    <!-- /Food Menu -->

    <!-- Map -->

    <!-- /Map -->

    <!-- Footer -->

    <!-- /Footer -->


    <!-- Insert JavaScript Here -->

</body>
</html>
```
2. Inside the css directory create a new file and name it `site.css`.
3. In your index.html file, add the appropriate `link tag` in the `<head>` element to link your `site.css` style sheet.

Now you have a basic html/css site to work with!

### Part B - Adding Content

Now we will add a little bit of content to our website, and add a little bit of layout.  Let's get started with the top section of the site.

In index.html, find the section labeled `Header` and paste in the following html:
```
<section class="header">
    <div class="wrap">
        <img src="img/louies-logo.svg">
        <nav id="main-nav" role="navigation">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Welcome</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">History</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Menu</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
        <div class="hero-block">
            <h1>World's Favorite Pizza!</h1>
            <p>Located on Clay Street, in NuLu, Louie’s Pizza is part of one of Louisville’s most lively neighborhoods. In close proximity to Downtown and near Washington Park, our NuLu pizzeria has a cool atmosphere suited for anyone looking to find a spot to hang out.</p>
            <a href="#" class="hero-button">View Menu</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>
```

Here we have added a section to our website.  This section contains a logo, navigation, and a "Hero Block" with informaiton about our website.  If you open Index.html in a web browser, it won't look like much now since we haven't added any CSS to our site.  Let's style this section to make it match the mobile version of the site as shown in the mobile.pdf file.  

### Part C - Styling the Header

#### Box Sizing
For this project, we'll use the border-box box-sizing method.  Add the following to site.css

```
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

#### Fonts
This site uses the Google fonts `Roboto` and `Roboto Slab`.  To use these fonts on our site, let's add the font stylesheet from Google to the head element inside index.html.

```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Slab:700|Roboto:300,300i,700,700i" rel="stylesheet">
```

#### Body

For the body element, set the margin and padding to 0, and the font-family to 'Roboto', sans-serif.

#### Headings

H1 headings should:
* Be upper case
* Have a font-size that is 2.5x larger than the base font size (1.2rem)
* Have a margin of 2rem for the top and bottom
* Have a font family of 'Roboto Slab' with a fallback to serif.  

#### Paragraphs

Paragraphs should:
* Have a font size that is 1.2x larger than the base font size (1.2rem)
* Have a bottom margin of 2rem.
* Have a font-weight of 300.

#### Anchors (Links)

Anchors should be white, with no text decoration;

#### Wrapper

The wrap class should have a 2rem padding all around.

#### Header Section

Now we're getting into specifics for the header section.  This section should set its background to the `hero-bg-pizza.jpg` image, have a background color of #333333, a font color of #FFFFFF, and have its text center-aligned.  The css for the header section should look like the following when you're done:

```
.header {
  background-color: #333333;
  background-image: url('../img/hero-bg-pizza.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;
  background-size: cover;
  color: #FFFFFF;
  text-align: center;
}
```

#### Navigation
* The font inside the navigation should have a font family of `Roboto Slab` with a fallback to `serif`.  The font should be bold, uppercase, and the text should be center aligned.  
* The `ul` element should be unstyled and have no padding.
* The li element should be set to display as block.
* The a element should have a padding of .5rem and should also be displayed as block.
* When the user hovers over an anchor tag, the background color should be set to #871719.

Here is an example of how the nav styling should look:

```
nav {
    font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;
    font-weight: bold;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    text-align: center;
}
nav ul {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
}

nav ul li {
   display: block;
}

nav a {
  padding: .5rem;
  display: block;
}

nav a:hover {
  background-color: #871719;
}
```

#### Hero Button
Finaly let's make a pretty button.  Target the hero-button class and apply the following:

* The font size should be 1.4x the base font size (1.4rem).
* The font family should be `Roboto Slab` with a fallback to `serif`.  The text should be uppercase and font should be bold.  
* There should be a 2px solid border that is white.  
* It should have a top/bottom padding of 6px with a left/right padding of 12px.  
* Then a user hovers over the button, the border color and background color should change to #871719.

Here is an example of what the css should look like:

```
.hero-button {
  font-size: 1.4rem;
  font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-weight: bold;
  border: 2px solid #FFFFFF;
  padding: 6px 12px;
}

.hero-button:hover {
  border-color: #871719;
  background-color: #871719;
}
```

Now we have a styled header section for our site!

## Challenge 2

Let's build out the Welcome and Mail List sections of our page.

### Welcome Section

This one is pretty simple.  Similar to the Header section, you will need a section element with a wrapper inside of it.  Inside the wrapper you should add a h2 with the words "Welcome to Louie's", but "Louie's" should be red (#871719).

Now add a paragraph below the h2 with the following text:

```
Enjoy the old-school ambiance, original wooden booths sentimentally etched by our loyal customers, the black and white art deco floors worn by time, turn of the century tin ceilings and faded murals tell tale of a bygone era. Sit back, relax, enjoy the smell of simmering tomatoes and hot pizza, feel the warmth and camaraderie, hear the laughter and conversation of happy diners and you feel like you are home again, somewhere familliar, comfortable, affordable, family centered and “ORIGINAL”.
```

Make sure that the h2 uses the 'Roboto Slab' font-family with a fallback to serif.  The font size for h2 should be 175% of the base font-size (1.75rem).

### Mail List Section

Similar to the Welcome section, you will need a section element with a wrapper inside of it.  Inside the wrapper you should add a h2 with the words "Join Louie's List today, and get a free slice!".

Create a new form element with a label of "Email", an input with placeholder text like "jsmith@gmail.com", and a submit button with the text "Sign Up."  Lastly, add a paragraph with the text "We promise not to SPAM you, unless you want it on your pie! Data charges may apply if your still using dial-up or AOL." and make it 80% of the base font size (.8rem).

The lable, input, and button should be block level elements that take 100% of the width of their containing element.  Create classes for the newsletter label, input and button.  Be sure that these classes contain the following CSS properties in addition to being displayed as block level elements, and having 100% width.

#### Label

```
    margin: 0 0 16px 0;
```

#### Input

```
    border: 1px solid #c0af8e;
    border-radius: 3px;
    height: 40px;
    padding: 8px;
    margin: 0 0 10px 0;
    font-size: 1rem;
```

#### Button

```
    background-color: #871719;
    border-radius: 3px;
    color: #FFFFFF;
    font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;
    font-size: .8rem;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-weight: bold;
    height: 40px;
```

Finally, let's make the "Sign Up" button change to purple (#800080) when the user hovers over it and set the background of the entire section to yellow (#E8D5B5).  We should now have a completed Mail List section that looks great on mobile devices.  

### Challenge 3

Just like before, add a section with a wrapper element inside the `Food Menu` section of `index.html`.

#### Intro Content
Start by adding the h2 and the paragraph as shown in the `mobile.pdf` file.  

```
<h2><span class="red">Louie's</span> Menu</h2>
<p>The “Hallmarks” of Louie’s of Clay St. are the coal fired brick ovens that churn out hundreds of crispy pizza’s daily. It’s a different world than it was in 1929, but we are still making the same traditional coal fired pizza in the oven that started it all back on Main Street.</p>
```

#### Setting Up Our Data
Create a directory named `js` and create a new file named `app.js`.  In `app.js` let's create a variable named `menu` and set it equal to the following JavaScript object:

```
{
  "Food": [
    {
      "name": "Salads",
      "items": [
        {
          "name": "Louie's Chef Salad",
          "price": 7.5
        },
        {

        {
          "name": "Good Morning",
          "price": 3
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

#### Looping Through Arrays

Below we have an example of what one menu category should look like.  There is a table head with an h4 for the category, which comes from the `name` key in each category object.  Inside each category object, there is an array of food or beverage items.  Each of these items should be a row in your table with two cells, one displaying the item name, and one displaying the item price.  Please note there are two arrays in the object, one for Food and one for Beverages.  Start by displaying Food first.

Using loops and string contatination, build the table for each category and then write it to the inside of the wrapper element inside the food menu section of `index.html`

```
<table class="menu">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"><h4 class="menu-head red">Salads</h4></th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Louie's Chef Salad</td>
            <td class="menu-price text-right">$7.50</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Caesar Salad</td>
            <td class="menu-price text-right">$9.00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Garden Salad</td>
            <td class="menu-price text-right">$6.25</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Side Salad</td>
            <td class="menu-price text-right">$3.50</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

#### Styling
Apply styling to the menu classes to match the style in the `mobile.pdf` file. Below are some example styles.  

```
h4 {
    font-size: 1.4rem;
    line-height: 1;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;
    font-weight: 700;
    margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;
}

#foodmenu .menu {
  width: 100%;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.menu-head {
  text-align: left;
}

.menu-price {
    color: #871719;
    font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-weight: 700;
    text-align: right;
}
```

### Challenge 4

Using **jQuery**, let's validate the Mail List form to ensure that the user has entered a valid email address.  

#### Include jQuery

Start by including jQuery in your index.html file.  You should add the following script tag _before_ your javascript file, since we want jQuery to be loaded before our JavaScript runs.

```
<script
  src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"
  integrity="sha256-hwg4gsxgFZhOsEEamdOYGBf13FyQuiTwlAQgxVSNgt4="
  crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

#### Validate the Email

Use jQuery's `keyup` method to check if an email is valid after each key stroke.  Show a validation message below the input field and disable the submit button if the email is not valid.  Below is a function you can use to check if an email is valid.  You can feed this function a string containing an email address to validate, and it will return `true` if it's valid, and `false` if it's not.

```
function isValidEmailAddress(emailAddress) {
    var pattern = /^([a-z\d!#$%&'*+\-\/=?^_`{|}~\u00A0-\uD7FF\uF900-\uFDCF\uFDF0-\uFFEF]+(\.[a-z\d!#$%&'*+\-\/=?^_`{|}~\u00A0-\uD7FF\uF900-\uFDCF\uFDF0-\uFFEF]+)*|"((([ \t]*\r\n)?[ \t]+)?([\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x7f\x21\x23-\x5b\x5d-\x7e\u00A0-\uD7FF\uF900-\uFDCF\uFDF0-\uFFEF]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0d-\x7f\u00A0-\uD7FF\uF900-\uFDCF\uFDF0-\uFFEF]))*(([ \t]*\r\n)?[ \t]+)?")@(([a-z\d\u00A0-\uD7FF\uF900-\uFDCF\uFDF0-\uFFEF]|[a-z\d\u00A0-\uD7FF\uF900-\uFDCF\uFDF0-\uFFEF][a-z\d\-._~\u00A0-\uD7FF\uF900-\uFDCF\uFDF0-\uFFEF]*[a-z\d\u00A0-\uD7FF\uF900-\uFDCF\uFDF0-\uFFEF])\.)+([a-z\u00A0-\uD7FF\uF900-\uFDCF\uFDF0-\uFFEF]|[a-z\u00A0-\uD7FF\uF900-\uFDCF\uFDF0-\uFFEF][a-z\d\-._~\u00A0-\uD7FF\uF900-\uFDCF\uFDF0-\uFFEF]*[a-z\u00A0-\uD7FF\uF900-\uFDCF\uFDF0-\uFFEF])\.?$/i;
    return pattern.test(emailAddress);
};
```

#### Button Click

Using jQuery, show an alert when the newsletter button is clicked that says "Server unavaliable, try again later!".  

### Challenge 5

In software development, it's not unusual to want to contribute or make changes to an existing git repository.  With Git, it's easy to make a copy of a repository and keep your own commit history without affecting the original repo.  Let's fork the FEWD Class Project repo, clone it to our local machine, make a change, and then push it back to our fork of the repo.  

1.) First go to https://github.com/CodeLouisville/May2017-FEWD-Class-Project (or the latest location of the repo) and click on the **Fork** button at the top right corner of the repo page.  Notice that the username in the url will change from https://github.com/`CodeLouisville` to https://github.com/`{myUsername}`.
2.) Click on the green **Clone or Download** button and copy the git url.  
3.) Open your console and `cd` into the directory where you would like the files to be cloned to.  
4.) In the console, type `git clone {theGitUrl}`.  This will make a local clone of your github repo.
5.) `cd` into the newly created folder.
6.) Check the status of your git repo by running `git status`.

#### Make a change

Now let's make a change to the project which we will later commit to our local repo, and finally push to our remote repo on github.  Let's add a footer to our website by adding the following markup to the **Footer** section of our site.

```
<footer>
    <div class="wrap">
        <p>© Copyright 2016 Louie’s Pizza</p>
        <p>
            <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a> | <a href="#">Terms of Use</a>
        </p>
    </div>
</footer>
```

Then add these styles to **style.css**.

```
footer {
    background-color: #333333;
    color: #F2F2F2;
}
```

#### Commit and Push

Now that we've made our changes, it's time to commit them and then push them back to our github repo.  

1.) Go back to your console and run `git status`.  You'll notice that you have two files that are listed as **modified**.  
2.) Before we can commit these changes, we need to stage the files that we want to commit.  You can do this by running `git add .` to stage all files.  Alternatively, you can stage individual files via `git add {myFileName}`.
3.) Run `git status` again to make sure your two files are staged.
4.) Let's commit these changes by running `git commit -m "My awesome commit message goes here"` replacing the commit message with your own.  
5.) Now that you've committed your changes, `git status` should reveal that your local branch is ahead of the remote branch.  Let's catch up the remote branch.  
6.) Run `git push origin master` to push your latest commits back to the github repo.  
7.) Run `git status` to confirm that your remote branch is now up-to-date with your local one.  

#### Adding remotes

Your local repo can track multiple remote repos.  This can be useful when you want to update your local repo with changes that were committed to the original repo you forked from.  

1.) Back on github, below the name of your repo is a link back to the repo it was forked form.  Click the link and copy the git url for the original repo.
2.) In your console, run `git remote add codelouisville {url to repo goes here}` to add the remote repo.  
3.) Now run `git remote -v` to list all the remote repos for your local repo.
4.) You can change the remote that your local branch is tracking by running `git branch -u codelouisville\master`.
5.) Now when you run `git status` you will be checking if your local branch is up-to-date with the code louisville remote repo.
6.) You can switch back to your fork on github by running `git branch -u origin/master`.
